2048-Pygame: A Python Implementation of the 2048 Game

This project is a recreation of the popular sliding block puzzle game, 2048, implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to 
combine them into a tile with the number 2048. Players can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. When two tiles with the same number collide,
they merge into a tile with their combined value.

Features
Smooth Animations: The game features smooth tile movements and merging animations.
Random Tile Generation: After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears at a random empty position.
Game Over Detection: The game automatically detects when no more moves are possible.
Attractive UI: The game has a visually appealing interface with different colors for different tile values.
